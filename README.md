unity3d-boilerplate
===========

Unity3d boilerplate. That's what title says. Yep. No restrictions whatsoever, **just don't use this to terrorize contries or something like that**.

What's inside?
-----------

1. Empty project.  
2. .gitignore for Unity3D (modified; heavily).  
3. Editor plugin for making cubemaps.  

How to use it?
-----------

Clone *it* and use *it*. Erm... Just open cloned directory with Unity Editor. Do git. Much win.

What can go wrong?
-----------

Everything. Especially, if you are paranoid, it may begin spawning *giant* chickens around your house. But worry not - they won't eat anyone or anything what has pulled *this*. Being stepped on is yet another question.
